<p>Wondering why wasn't you who came out from nothing <p>
<p>Make it from the bottom <p>
<p>Now when you see me I'm strutting<p> 
<p>And all of my cause a way to push up a button <p>
<p>Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you can it <p>
<p>Switched the number to my phone <p>
<p>So you never can call it <p>
<p>Don't need my name,or my show <p>
<p>Swish you can tell it I'm ballin' <p>
<p>What a shame coulda got pictures <p>
<p>Had a really good game but you missed your last shot<p>
<p>So you talk about who you see at the top<p>
<p>Or what you could've saw <p>
<p>But sad to say it's over for it <p>
<p>Phantom roll out valet open doors<p>
<p>Where's the car way,got what you was looking for<p>
<p>Now ask me who they want <p>
<p>So you can go take that little piece of shit with you <p>
<p>I'm at a payphone trying to call home <p>
<p>All of my change I've spent on you <p>
<p>Where are times gone baby <p>
<p>It's all wrong,we're at the place we make for two <p>
<p>If happy ever after did exist <p>
<p>I would be holding you like this <p>
<p>And all these fairytales are full of it <p>
<p>One more stupid love song I'll be safe <p>
<p>Now I'm at a payphone <p>
